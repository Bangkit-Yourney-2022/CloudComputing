Request Body (x-www-form-urlencoded):

```shell
{
    "question": "Who does mental illness affect?",
}
```

Response :

```shell
{
    "Answer": "it is estimated that mental illness affects 1 in 5 adults in america, and that 1 in 24 adults have a serious mental illness. mental illness does not discriminate; it can affect anyone, regardless of gender, age, income, social status, ethnicity, religion, sexual orientation, or background. although mental illness can affect anyone, certain conditions may be more common in different populations. for instance, eating disorders tend to occur more often in females, while disorders such as attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder is more prevalent in children. additionally, all ages are susceptible, but the young and the old are especially vulnerable. mental illnesses usually strike individuals in the prime of their lives, with 75 percent of mental health conditions developing by the age of 24. this makes identification and treatment of mental disorders particularly difficult, because the normal personality and behavioral changes of adolescence may mask symptoms of a mental health condition. parents and caretakers should be aware of this fact, and take notice of changes in their childs mood, personality, personal habits, and social withdrawal. when these occur in children under 18, they are referred to as serious emotional disturbances (seds)."
